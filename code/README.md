Every time the bot is launched, training is started based on the available data in intense.json

You can change the data either by hand in the intense.json file itself,
or through the bot's telegrams, following its instructions

If via a bot telegram, then you need to use the command <b>/addtraining</b>.
After all the additions, you need to start the training itself - <b>/training</b>

### Requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Start
```bash
python main.py
```
